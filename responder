#responder is a python utility for attacking LLMNR
responder -I <int> -i <ip> #to listen for one specific IP, otherwise will listen on whole network by default

#when target computer on network requests system that does not exist, responder will send a LLMNR answer
#then capture the hash of SMB creds from target
#captured info will be saved to /opt/responder/logs
